How to run: 
Download Yale dataset and run it with matlab.

The Extended Yale B database consists of 2,414 frontal-face images of 38 individuals. The cropped and normalized 192 * 168 face images were captured under various laboratory-controlled lighting conditions. For each subject, I randomly select half of the images for training (i.e., about 32 images per subject) and the other half for testing.
